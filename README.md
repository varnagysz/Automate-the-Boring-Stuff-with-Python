# Automate-the-Boring-Stuff-with-Python
My version of answers to practice projects from Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. https://automatetheboringstuff.com/

Please be aware that these answers are up-to-date with the skill required at certain point of tutorial, so, of course, it might be a lot better way to solve it and the code itself sometimes is against Python style guide. I hope you will find it handy, as much as I hope you will try to solve the task before skipping in here! Have fun.
